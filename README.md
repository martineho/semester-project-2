This was my spring 2022 Semester Project at Noroff. The goal of the project was to create an e-commerce website that had customer-facing and admin sections. Fetching data from a Strapi API. 

I chose to make the UI for a skincare web shop. Using plain Html, Vanilla Javascript, Bootstrap and Sass. 

## ⚛️ Technologies used

- Html
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

## 👩🏻‍💻 Installation and setup 

Clone down this repository. 

In VS code you will need to install `Live Server extension` to view it in the browser and I recommend installing `Live Sass Compiler` for handling the sass > css conversion. 

To open it in the browser with Live Server, right click in any html file and click Open with Live Server.

User credentials to test admin functionality:

username: admin
