## 👩🏻‍💻 Installation and setup 

Clone down this repository. 

In VS code you will need to install `Live Server extension` to view it in the browser and I recommend installing `Live Sass Compiler` for handling the sass > css conversion. 

To open it in the browser with Live Server, right click in any html file and click Open with Live Server.

To test login:
